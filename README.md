# Python Tutorial



Here you can find the Jupyter Notebooks of our Python tutorial, part of Northeasternâ€™s department of Bioengineering *Essential Tools for Biomedical Engineering*.  	

All lessons in this module are organized as Jupyter Notebooks. This means that you can actually run the code examples, or change them and run them again to see what happens. We also included some brief exercises for you embedded in the notebooks - which you can code and run in the same notebook. 

How you view and run these notebooks? There are several options. 

- If you installed the anaconda distribution of Python (which we recommend), then you already have Jupyter installed on your computer. If you want to run the notebooks on your own computer, start by cloning this repo to your hard drive.
Once you have the files, open your terminal, type 
`jupyter lab`
and wait for the Jupyter interface to open in your default browser. On the left, you will see a file browser, which you can use to navigate to the directory where you saved the course notebooks. Double click on the one you wish to open, and you're good to go. 
- You can run these notebooks on Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Levine-Lab-Northeastern/Python-Tutorial/HEAD)
- You can run the notebooks on Google Colaboratory.  (Links to an external site.)In the 'open notebook' panel hit 'GiuHub', copy-paste 'https://github.com/Levine-Lab-Northeastern/Python-Tutorial', and hit search. This will show you the list of course notebooks and let you open the one you want to work on.
- If you work with Visual Code, you can run Jupyter Notebooks in your IDE. See more information here. (Links to an external site.)

One you have a notebook open, feel free to change and add whatever you want - this will not be shared or influence others. The way Jupyter notebooks work is explained in the notebook of Lesson 1.
